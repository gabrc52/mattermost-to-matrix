# Mattermost to Matrix migration

Automate migrating from Mattermost to Matrix

Note that this is for migrating past messages to Matrix. To copy over present and future messages in real-time, what you need is a bridge, such as [matrix-appservice-mattermost](https://matrix.org/bridges/#mattermost) or [matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/) (note that as of April 2023, full Matrix integration in matterbridge is an unmerged PR).

**This is work-in-progress**
